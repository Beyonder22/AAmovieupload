# AAmovieupload
This app is designed for my 5th semester mini project. It is developed using Android studio and Java. Google Firebase is used as the database. This app uploads movies and description along with its thumbnail and its genre on firebase allowing the client to watch the uploaded content on aamovies streaming app.
